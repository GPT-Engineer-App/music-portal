# music-portal

design a website for me with the following tabs on the vertical navigation bar on the left side: *Home*, *Browse Music*: This tab allows users to explore music by genre, artist, or other criteria. It could include the subcategories like "Top Hits,""New Releases" or "Recommended.", *Search*, *Playlist*, *User Profile*, *Albums*, *Blog/News*,* Contact/Support*. Put the links of my social media accounts: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Apple Music, YouTube, Audiomax, TikTok. Let the social media links be linked to my social media accounts
